We hope that you have picked up some useful skills in this IntroR course and are motivated to keep learning R. If you run into questions down the road, feel free to reach out to either one of us. 

We're also planning a second workshop emphasizing spatial data manipulation and analysis, which will include:

1. The apply family
2. Joining data
3. Wrangling Spatial Data using the simple feature package
4 Using dates and times
5. Mapping spatial data (e.g. leaflet, baseR plotting, etc.)
6. Implementing and exploring key differences between Kaplan Meier and Cox Proportional Hazard survival analyses.
