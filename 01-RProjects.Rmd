# Intro to R and R-Studio {#intro}

## Learning R
I first started learning R in an undergraduate Statistics course. I remember
thinking it was amazing for doing complex calculations, but I honestly
had no idea how the programming worked. I just knew that using certain code would produce output that I needed. This is common for a lot of people. We learn how to run whatever analyses, but miss out on basic fundamentals. 90% of the time when an analysis won't run, it isn't a statistics problem, but a programming problem (i.e. the data isn't assigned the right data type, the data is being indexed wrong, etc). Knowing how to program can also help with reproducibility. The goal of this course is to help you develop basic programming skills, separate from any kind of analyses, and steps for troubleshooting in R.

## What is R?
R is both the name of the programming language and the software used for data storage and manipulation. 

RStudio is the interface. You will need to download [R](https://cran.r-project.org) before downloading
[RStudio](https://posit.co/downloads/). RStudio allows you to keep track of your code, working directory, and environment all in one place. I keep R and RStudio in my applications folder on my macbook and on my C drive on PCs. 

When you first open RStudio, you will be greeted by three panels:

![](./docs/files/RStudio.png)

1) **The Interactive R Console (entire left)**
* R scripts appear in the top left. This is where you write your code. When you execute this code, it appears in the Console (bottom left). You can run code from the console, but it will be forgotten once you close R. It's best to write a saveable script in the code editor where you can send lines of code to the console to be executed.
2) **Environment/History (tabbed in upper right)**
* Environment: collection of objects (i.e. variables, data frames, functions, etc.) that we define
* History: this contains every line of code executed during the session
3) **Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer (tabbed in lower right)**
  + **Files** shows all the files in your working directory. A **working directory** is essentially the default folder that R is reading data from/putting output into. We will go through setting the working directory below. You can also create, delete, and rename files and folders from this tab.
  + **Plots** displays plots that you generate
  + **Packages** displays any packages you have downloaded and installed in R. If there is a check mark next to a package, it means you've loaded it into your current R session
  + **Help** will show you a description of functions. To get a function description, simply run `?` followed by the function name. For example, `?setwd()` will show me the documentation for the `setwd()` function.

## RStudio Projects
RProjects are a self-contained, portable work space where you can have your data, code, and output all in one place. It's essentially all the things that you need for your analyses all in one place. RProjects are great to use for reproducibility because they are easy to share. Let's go through how to set up an RProject.

**Steps for Making an RProject**

![](./docs/files/RProject.png)

1) Open the “File” menu from the upper left.
2) Then select “New Project”.
3) Select “New Directory”.
4) Select “Empty Project”.
5) Enter a directory name
6) Select the “Create Project” button.

Every time you open this project the working directory will always be set to the folder `Intro-to-R-Workshop`! Projects are useful because you don't have to assign the working directory. The working directory is automatically set to the folder that your RProject is located. 

For example, if my RProject is located in <em>C:/Teaching/IntroR/</em>, my working directory is also located <em>C:/Teaching/IntroR/</em>. 

## Using Comments

Use the `#` to tell R you are making a comment. Comments are used to explain code and allow someone unfamiliar with your code to follow more easily. Commenting can also be used to prevent R from running specific lines of code since R ignores anything that follows the `#` mark.

```{r}
# 567*5 tells R that 567*5 is a comment, and so R knows not to execute this line of code.
```

Sometimes you want to comment out large sections of code, and this can be done using `control + shift + c` on windows or `command + shift + c` on a macbook.

## Installing Packages

Sometimes you will need/want to use tools that are not built into the baseR code. You can download these tools from R repositories as `packages`.

```{r error=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse") # install a new package
library(tidyverse) # call a package you previously downloaded
```

If there are functions with the same name in 2 different packages, R will 
arbitrarily mask one of them. To get around this, simply specify which package
you intend to use the function from. For example, the 'filter' function exists in both tidyverse and dplyr. If I specifically want to use the tidyverse version, I could run `dplyr::filter()`.
