**USE GOOGLE!**
Using a google search will most often give you results that can answer your questions. Most packages have a documentation page that you can google if you don't understand how it works too.

It's important to note that you are using the programming language R, and the objective that you want to take.

**Never be afraid to google if you run into trouble! The website [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com) is your friend.**
