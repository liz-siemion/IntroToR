## Document your code
It's good practice to include comments and documentation explaining what your code is doing and why. This makes it easier to understand your code, which can be useful if your code is complex or you haven't worked with it in awhile. Good documentation helps with debugging, collaboration, and keeping your workflow organized and reproducible. RMarkdown and README files are useful methods for documenting your progress.  

## Rows for Observations, Columns for Variables
When organizing your data, it is best to keep it in long format, where each row represents a new observation and each column represents a new variable. 

## Problemmatic Practices

* Avoid putting units in cells
* Avoid using problematic column Names with white spaces
* Recognize the difference between zero and a missing value
* Ensure that you consistently format your values in your spreadsheets
